        <description>Markdown Cheat Sheet Thanks for visiting The Markdown Guide!
This Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements. It can’t cover every edge case, so if you need more information about any of these elements, refer to the reference guides for basic syntax and extended syntax.
Basic Syntax These are the elements outlined in John Gruber’s original design document. All Markdown applications support these elements.</description>

        <description>Yanan (Yaya) Guo Hi there! I am currently a third-year PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh, working with my advisor Dr. Jun Yang in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I graduated from Xidian University in 2018 with a B.S. in whatever.
My research interest lies in the areas of computer architecture and security, with a focus on memory attacks and defenses, ML attacks and defenses, and quantum computer.</description>
