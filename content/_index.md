Hi there! I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of
Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu). I received my Ph.D. from Pitt, where I worked with my advisor [Dr. Jun
Yang](https://sites.pitt.edu/~juy9/) on computer architecture and computer security.

**<span style="color: green">Research Interests:</span>**  
My research interests lie in computer architecture and cybersecurity, with a focus on the following areas:  
<i class="fas fa-paperclip"></i> GPU memory safety (e.g., **<a href="files/usenix24_2.pdf" style="color: #464646"> [USENIX Security'24]</a>**).  
<i class="fas fa-paperclip"></i> CPU/GPU side channels (e.g., **<a href="files/ndss26.pdf" style="color: #464646"> [NDSS'26]</a>**).    
<i class="fas fa-paperclip"></i> GPU microarchitecture characterization and optimization (e.g.,  **<a href="files/micro25.pdf" style="color: #464646"> [MICRO'25]</a>**).  


**<span style="color: green">Openings:</span>** **I am looking for new PhD students to join my research team. If you are interested, please send me an email with your CV.**  

**<span style="color: green">Office Hours:</span>** **I dedicate 30 minutes every week to provide guidance or suggestions for undergraduate students. If you need help or wish to discuss topics such as life, career paths, graduate school applications, or research ideas, please send me an email to schedule a meeting.**
