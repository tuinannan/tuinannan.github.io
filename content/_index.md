Hi there! I am currently a PhD student at the [University of
Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu), working with my advisor [Dr. Jun
Yang](https://sites.pitt.edu/~juy9/) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering
Department. I graduated from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/) in
2018 with a B.S. in Telecommunications Engineering.

My research interests lie in the areas of computer architecture and security, with a focus on side channel security and memory safety.

Topics of Research & My Major Contributions:  
**Side channel attacks:** proposed three new CPU side channels and countermeasures.  
**Memory safety:** proved the feasibility of CUDA code injection and ROP attacks.  
**Memory integrity:** proposed a hardware design and a software design for integrity protection.
