## Yanan (Yaya) Guo

Hi there! I am currently a third-year PhD student at the [University of
Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu), working with my advisor [Dr. Jun
Yang](https://sites.pitt.edu/~juy9/) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering
Department. I graduated from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/) in
2018 with a B.S. in whatever.


My research interest lies in the areas of computer architecture and security,
with a focus on memory attacks and defenses, ML attacks and defenses, and
quantum computer.
